## Welcome to my dev blog

Hello. My name is Rodrigo. I am from Brazil and here you can find my personal works I have been doing with game programming.
My last works are targeting mainly in Unreal game engine and game engine programming.

### Last Studies

My last studies are in developing a math library to be used in the rain forest engine. It will feature math game programming related functions such as operations in vectors, matrices and quaternions.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/reisro/rainforest/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
