## Welcome to my dev blog

Hello. My name is Rodrigo. I am from Brazil and here you can find my personal works I have been doing with game programming.
My last works are targeting mainly in Unreal game engine and game engine programming.

### Math Library

My last studies are in developing a math library to be used in the rain forest engine. It will feature math game programming related functions such as operations in vectors, matrices and quaternions.

I start with a Vector class that will represent a Vector, of course, in the library. Basic constructor and override constructors with diferent parameters to make it flexible enough.

```c++
class rfVector3
{
public:

	// constructors
	rfVector3();
	rfVector3(double x, double y, double z);
	rfVector3(const rfVector3& _vector);
	~rfVector3();
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/reisro/rainforest/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
